    <h2>Early Life</h2>

Sir Michael Philip Jagger, known to the world as Mick Jagger, was born on July 26, 1943, in Dartford, Kent, England. His father, Basil Fanshawe "Joe" Jagger, was a teacher, and his mother, Eva Ensley Mary, was an active member of the Conservative Party. Growing up in a middle-class family, Mick attended Wentworth Primary School, where he first met Keith Richards. This childhood friendship would later blossom into one of the most iconic musical partnerships in rock history.

Jagger's early interest in music was evident, and he was a fan of American blues and rhythm and blues artists. This passion for music ran parallel to his academic endeavors. He attended Dartford Grammar School and later gained a scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. Although he showed promise in his academic pursuits, his love for music soon took precedence.

<br>

In 1962, Jagger, along with childhood friend Keith Richards, formed The Rolling Stones, bringing in Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman to complete the lineup. The band quickly gained popularity in the UK, becoming known for their rebellious image and raw, energetic performances. Their early music was heavily influenced by American blues, a genre that Jagger particularly admired.

The Rolling Stones' first single, a cover of Chuck Berry's "Come On," was released in 1963. It was their subsequent singles and the charismatic stage presence of Jagger that began to set them apart from other British bands. By 1964, they had released their first self-titled album, which included a mix of original songs and blues covers, and they were beginning to achieve international fame.

<h2>Rise to Fame and Controversy</h2>

The mid-1960s saw The Rolling Stones become one of the leading bands of the British Invasion, challenging The Beatles' dominance in the music world. Jagger's provocative and flamboyant stage persona became a defining element of the band's identity. Hits like "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction," "Paint It Black," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash" cemented their status as rock icons.

However, their rise to fame was not without controversy. The band's bad-boy image, legal troubles, and drug-related arrests added to their notoriety. Jagger himself was arrested multiple times for drug possession, but these incidents only seemed to enhance the band's rebellious allure.

The late 1960s and 1970s marked a period of evolution for The Rolling Stones.

Jagger's songwriting partnership with Richards flourished, producing some of rock's most enduring anthems.

Despite internal conflicts and the tragic death of Brian Jones in 1969, the band persevered. Jagger's leadership and vision were instrumental in navigating the group through these turbulent times. His ability to reinvent himself and the band's sound contributed to their longevity.
